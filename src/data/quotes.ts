    text: "The stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient.", 
    author: "Warren Buffett",
    explanation: "Short-term investors react emotionally to price movements, news, and market noise. They often sell during panic and buy during excitement. Patient investors who stay invested in strong businesses benefit from these emotional mistakes. Over long periods, patience allows earnings growth and compounding to work in their favor."
  },
  { 
    text: "Price is what you pay. Value is what you get.", 
    author: "Warren Buffett",
    explanation: "The stock price is just a number decided by market participants at a moment in time. Value comes from the company’s ability to generate cash, grow profits, and survive competition. A good investment happens when you buy a valuable business at a reasonable or discounted price. Confusing price with value leads to overpaying."
  },
  { 
    text: "In the short run, the market is a voting machine, but in the long run it is a weighing machine.", 
    author: "Benjamin Graham",
    explanation: "Short-term stock prices reflect popularity, headlines, emotions, and crowd psychology. This is the “voting” phase, where opinions dominate. Over time, however, profits, cash flow, and balance-sheet strength determine true worth. Eventually, fundamentals outweigh emotions."
  },
  { 
    text: "Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.", 
    author: "Warren Buffett",
    explanation: "When everyone is optimistic, prices often become inflated and risk increases. When fear dominates, even good companies can be sold at cheap prices. This quote encourages contrarian thinking—acting opposite to the crowd when emotions reach extremes. Discipline is required because it feels uncomfortable."
  },
  { 
    text: "The four most dangerous words in investing are: ‘This time it’s different.’", 
    author: "Sir John Templeton",
    explanation: "Every bubble is justified by a story that claims old rules no longer apply. History shows that human behavior—greed, fear, and speculation—never changes. Ignoring past lessons leads to repeated mistakes. Markets may evolve, but cycles always return."
  },
  { 
    text: "Know what you own, and know why you own it.", 
    author: "Peter Lynch",
    explanation: "If you understand a company’s business, you are less likely to panic during downturns. Knowing why you invested helps you decide when to hold, add, or sell. Without understanding, every price drop feels like danger. Clarity builds confidence."
  },
  { 
    text: "The investor’s chief problem—and even his worst enemy—is likely to be himself.", 
    author: "Benjamin Graham",
    explanation: "Most investing mistakes come from emotional reactions rather than lack of knowledge. Fear causes selling at the bottom, and greed causes buying at the top. Self-discipline and emotional control matter more than intelligence. Successful investing is largely behavioral."
  },
  { 
    text: "Risk comes from not knowing what you’re doing.", 
    author: "Warren Buffett",
    explanation: "Risk increases when investors buy businesses they don’t understand. Lack of knowledge leads to uncertainty and panic when prices fluctuate. Understanding the company, industry, and financials reduces real risk. Volatility alone is not danger."
  },
  { 
    text: "Wide diversification is only required when investors do not understand what they are doing.", 
    author: "Warren Buffett",
    explanation: "Diversification protects against ignorance but can reduce potential returns. Investors who deeply understand a few businesses may concentrate their investments. However, concentration increases risk if understanding is flawed. This approach requires experience and discipline."
  },
  { 
    text: "Markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.", 
    author: "John Maynard Keynes",
    explanation: "Even when you are correct about fundamentals, prices may move against you for long periods. Overconfidence, leverage, or poor risk control can wipe out capital. Being right too early can still lead to losses. Survival is more important than prediction."
  },
  { 
    text: "Time in the market beats timing the market.", 
    author: "Ken Fisher",
    explanation: "Trying to predict market tops and bottoms often leads to missed opportunities. Staying invested allows compounding to work uninterrupted. Even missing a few strong days can reduce long-term returns significantly. Consistency beats prediction."
  },
  { 
    text: "An investment in knowledge pays the best interest.", 
    author: "Benjamin Franklin",
    explanation: "Learning about finance, psychology, and businesses improves decisions permanently. Knowledge compounds just like money over time. It helps avoid costly mistakes and builds confidence. Education is a lifelong asset."
  },
  { 
    text: "Bull markets are born on pessimism… and die on euphoria.", 
    author: "Sir John Templeton",
    explanation: "Markets rise when expectations are low and risk is underestimated. As optimism grows, valuations expand. Eventually, euphoria leads to reckless behavior and bubbles. Understanding sentiment helps investors stay cautious at peaks."
  },
  { 
    text: "The stock market is filled with individuals who know the price of everything, but the value of nothing.", 
    author: "Philip Fisher",
    explanation: "Many investors focus on daily price movements instead of business quality. True value comes from long-term earning power and competitive advantage. Obsessing over prices leads to shallow decisions. Value investing requires deeper analysis."
  },
  { 
    text: "The biggest risk of all is not taking one.", 
    author: "Mellody Hobson",
    explanation: "Avoiding investments entirely exposes investors to inflation risk. Cash loses purchasing power over time. Reasonable risk-taking is necessary for wealth creation. The key is calculated risk, not reckless behavior."
  },
  { 
    text: "Don’t look for the needle in the haystack. Just buy the haystack.", 
    author: "John C. Bogle",
    explanation: "Trying to pick winning stocks is difficult and uncertain. Index investing captures overall market growth at low cost. This approach reduces emotional errors and complexity. Simplicity increases consistency."
  },
  { 
    text: "Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world.", 
    author: "Albert Einstein",
    explanation: "Compounding allows returns to generate further returns. Over long periods, growth becomes exponential. Starting early dramatically increases final wealth. Time is the most powerful factor."
  },
  { 
    text: "You don’t have to be brilliant to invest successfully.", 
    author: "Warren Buffett",
    explanation: "Average intelligence with strong discipline outperforms high intelligence with poor behavior. Emotional control and patience matter more than complex strategies. Avoiding mistakes is often enough to succeed."
  },
  { 
    text: "The goal of a successful trader is to make the best trades.", 
    author: "Alexander Elder",
    explanation: "Not every opportunity should be acted upon. Selectivity improves results and reduces losses. Quality decisions matter more than quantity. Discipline separates professionals from amateurs."
  },
  { 
    text: "Cash combined with courage in a crisis is priceless.", 
    author: "Warren Buffett",
    explanation: "Market crashes create rare buying opportunities. Investors with liquidity and emotional strength can acquire great businesses cheaply. Preparation before a crisis is essential. Courage during fear creates outsized returns."
  },
  { 
    text: "Cut your losses short and let your winners run.", 
    author: "Jesse Livermore",
    explanation: "Small losses protect capital and emotional balance. Holding losers too long magnifies damage. Successful investments should be allowed time to grow. Risk control is more important than profit chasing."
  },
  { 
    text: "The market is never wrong; opinions often are.", 
    author: "Jesse Livermore",
    explanation: "Prices reflect collective judgment and information. Fighting the market without evidence can be costly. Flexibility is essential when facts change. Ego has no place in investing."
  },
  { 
    text: "Money is made by sitting, not trading.", 
    author: "Jesse Livermore",
    explanation: "Most wealth is created by holding good investments over time. Frequent trading increases costs and mistakes. Patience allows compounding to work. Activity is not productivity."
  },
  { 
    text: "There are no called strikes in investing.", 
    author: "Warren Buffett",
    explanation: "You are not forced to act on every opportunity. Waiting for high-quality setups is acceptable. Avoiding bad investments is as important as making good ones. Discipline protects capital."
  },
  { 
    text: "Patience is the key element of success.", 
    author: "Bill Gross",
    explanation: "Markets reward long-term thinking. Short-term noise distracts investors from fundamentals. Staying invested allows returns to accumulate steadily. Impatience leads to poor timing."
  },
  { 
    text: "Investing should be more like watching paint dry.", 
    author: "Paul Samuelson",
    explanation: "Excitement often indicates speculation. Boring strategies are repeatable and reliable. Long-term wealth creation is slow and steady. Simplicity reduces emotional errors."
  },
  { 
    text: "Volatility is not risk.", 
    author: "Charlie Munger",
    explanation: "Price swings are normal and expected. Real risk is permanent loss of capital. Strong businesses can withstand volatility. Emotional reactions turn volatility into losses."
  },
  { 
    text: "If you can’t stomach 50% declines, you’ll get mediocre returns.", 
    author: "Charlie Munger",
    explanation: "Large drawdowns are part of equity investing. Those who panic miss recoveries. Emotional resilience is essential for high returns. Comfort often limits performance."
  },
  { 
    text: "Successful investing is about managing risk, not avoiding it.", 
    author: "Benjamin Graham",
    explanation: "Risk cannot be eliminated completely. Margin of safety and diversification reduce damage. Controlled risk allows growth while protecting capital. Balance is key."

  { 
    text: "Buy businesses, not stocks.", 
    author: "Common investing maxim",
    explanation: "Stocks represent ownership in real companies. Focus on business quality, management, and durability. Price fluctuations are secondary. Ownership mindset improves decisions."
